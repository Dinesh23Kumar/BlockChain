Project Title:

"Transaction-Enabled Blockchain Implementation in C++ with Basic Mining"

Project Description:

This project demonstrates a basic blockchain implementation in C++ that supports transaction management and mining. 
Each block can contain multiple transactions, represented by a Transaction class that includes sender, receiver, and amount details. 
The Block class handles transaction addition and calculates a unique hash for each block, ensuring data integrity. Starting with a genesis block, the project allows for creating new blocks linked through hashes. 
It serves as an educational tool to understand fundamental blockchain concepts, such as block creation, transaction handling, and mining, forming a foundation for further exploration of advanced blockchain features.
